4. Practice handling an XHR response

## Introduction

We often find ourselves needing more data than we can, or should,
load at one time. Data takes memory to store, and bandwidth to request
from a server, and both of those things are finite resources.

Not to mention how taxing it could be on the end user.

Imagine walking into a library and all of the books in the library were
immediately dropped in front of you. Overwhelming! You wouldn't be able
to process all that, and the likelihood is that all the books in the
library wouldn't fit in a single stack - the ceiling wouldn't be high
enough.

Now imagine that this library also had access to every book in every
library across the world.

Too many books. Too many books. Too many books, too many books.

When we go to a library to research something (surely somebody still
does this), we only request the books we need as we need them, and until
we do, they remain stored safely on thier shelves out of everyone's way.

Similarly, when working with server data, we often want to just request
the data we need as we need it.

JavaScript provides a mechanism for that. The [`XMLHttpRequest`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest).

## XMLHttpRequest

The XMLHttpRequest object, or XHR, is a JavaScript API that allows us to
transfer data between a client and a server.

It was named at a time when XML was all the rage, but it can be used
with any type of data, including JSON, which is the current de facto
standard.

XHR helps us write dynamic programs by allowing us to fetch data from a
server based on user events, and update parts of pages without requiring
a full-page refresh. This provides users with a smooth, engaging
experience that doesn't require them to stop what they're doing to get
new information.

## Using XHR to Get Data from a Server

We're going to be making a simple Github repository browser using the
[Github API](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/). Code along in the
provided `index.html` and `index.js` files. A basic HTML structure is
already in place.

Getting data from a server via XHR happens in two stages. First, we make
a *request*, and then we listen for, and handle, the *response*.

### Creating the XHR Request

The first thing we want to do is get a list of our public repositories.
A little research on the [Github List Repositories
API](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#list-user-repositories)
tells us we can request a user's public repositories via a `GET` request
to `https://api.github.com/users/:username/repos`, so let's try it out.

**Top-tip:** API documentation will often use a colon to precede a
dynamic value in a RESTful URL, like `:username`. That's your hint to
supply your own value.

First, let's add a link to our HTML so we can trigger the request.

```html
<div>
  <h3>Repositories</h3>
  <a href="#" onclick="getRepositories()">Get Repositories</a>
</div>
```

Then let's create our `getRepositories` function and initiate our XHR
request.

```js
function getRepositories() {
  const req = new XMLHttpRequest()
  req.open("GET", 'https://api.github.com/users/octocat/repos')
  req.send()
}
```

Here, we're creating a new instance of an `XMLHttpRequest`. We call
`open` with the HTTP verb we want, in this case `GET`, and the URI for
the request.

Now that our request is set up and ready to go, we call `send` to make
it happen.

Let's open `index.html` in our browser, open the inspector's `Network`
tab, and click the link.

Something happened! If we examine the request in the inspector, we
should see a response that looks something like this:

```js
[
  {
    "id": 18221276,
    "name": "git-consortium",
    "full_name": "octocat/git-consortium",
    "owner": {
      "login": "octocat",
      "id": 583231,
      "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/583231?v=3",
      "gravatar_id": "",
      "url": "https://api.github.com/users/octocat",
      "html_url": "https://github.com/octocat",
      "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/octocat/followers",
      "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/octocat/following{/other_user}",
      "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/octocat/gists{/gist_id}",
      "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/octocat/starred{/owner}{/repo}",
      "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/octocat/subscriptions",
      "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/octocat/orgs",
      "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/octocat/repos",
      "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/octocat/events{/privacy}",
      "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/octocat/received_events",
      "type": "User",
      "site_admin": false
    },
//... more!
```

It worked! We successfully fetched data from a remote resource with XHR without
reloading our page!

Now that we have the request part down, we need to figure out how to
capture this response so we can do something with it.

### Handling the XHR Response

The second part of XHR is handling the response once we've made the
request. We do this by defining an event listener on the request to
listen for the `load` event, which will tell us that the request is
complete. We'll give this listener a *callback function*, which is
simply a function that will get called when the event fires.

```js
function showRepositories(event, data) {
  //this is set to the XMLHttpRequest object that fired the event
  console.log(this.responseText)
}

function getRepositories() {
  const req = new XMLHttpRequest()
  req.addEventListener("load", showRepositories);
  req.open("GET", 'https://api.github.com/users/octocat/repos')
  req.send()
}
```

When we add the event listener to our `req` object, we set it up so that
`this` will be our `req` object inside our callback function. So, inside
`showRepositories`, we can access `this.responseText` to see the full
body of the response from our XHR request.

Now that we know how to access the response, let's do something with it.

### Parsing the XHR Response

Since the Github API deals strictly in JSON, we know that our response
will be well-formed JSON, so it should be easy for us to work with.

Let's parse this response and list out the repositories on the page.
We'll start by giving ourselves a place in the DOM to put the data.

```html
<div>
  <h3>Repositories</h3>
  <a href="#" onclick="getRepositories()">Get Repositories</a>
  <div id="repositories"></div>
</div>
```

Then let's start by simply listing the repository names.

```js
function showRepositories(event, data) {
  console.log(this.responseText)
  let repoList = "<ul>"
  for(var i=0;i < this.responseText.length; i++) {
    repoList += "<li>" + this.responseText[i]["name"] + "</li>"
  }
  repoList += "</ul>"
  document.getElementById("repositories").innerHTML = repoList
}
```

Now if we reload and click our link...

![jim hides](http://i.giphy.com/FGTVmzksb2j0k.gif)

Okay not quite what we expected. While it might be fun to have a list of
a million `undefined` values on a page, we got repositories to print
out. What happened?

The key lies in the `responseText` property. We can look at it and
understand that it's JSON, but to our JavaScript interpreter, it's just
a string of text. And while we *know* that all JSON is just a string of
text, we have to *tell* JavaScript that it's working with JSON.

This might seem annoying, but honestly, if a computer can't
innately know that some text is really JSON, it also probably can't become
sentient. And that's good for all of us.

![thumbs up](http://i.giphy.com/gFwZfXIqD0eNW.gif)

The way we tell the interpreter that we're working with JSON is to parse
it with [`JSON.parse`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse).

```js
function showRepositories(event, data) {
  var repos = JSON.parse(this.responseText)
  console.log(repos)
  const repoList = `<ul>${repos.map(r => '<li>' + r.name + '</li>').join('')}</ul>`
  document.getElementById("repositories").innerHTML = repoList
}
```

Now we're properly parsing the text into an array of objects that we can
work with. If we reload and try it again, we should get our list of
repository names.

Okay, let's take this a step further and set ourselves up to make
another XHR request based on our data.

We want to be able to list the commits for any given repository. Again,
we don't want to just re-query the server for each repository as we're
processing that data, we just want to respond to the user asking for a
specific repo's commits.

Let's go back into the Github API docs for [commits](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/commits/) and check it out.

We can see that we can make another `GET` request to `/repos/:owner/:repo/commits` and list the commits. We have the repo name to fill in for the `:repo` parameter based on our repo list. Let's say "repo" a few more times for fun then see what we can do.

We know we'll need an element to click for each repository on our page
that will request that repository's commits. So we'll need to add a "Get
Commits" link to our output in `showRepositories`, make a new XHR
request when that link is clicked, and then show the commits in the
second column.

We'll start by adding the link to our repository output.

```js
function showRepositories(event, data) {
  var repos = JSON.parse(this.responseText)
  console.log(repos)
  const repoList = `<ul>${repos.map(r => '<li>' + r.name + ' - <a href="#" data-repo="' + r.name + '" onclick="getCommits(this)">Get Commits</a></li>').join('')}</ul>`
  document.getElementById("repositories").innerHTML = repoList
}
```

Let's look more closely at this line: `r.name + ' - <a href="#" data-repo="' + r.name + '" onclick="getCommits(this)">Get Commits</a></li>'`.

The first interesting thing is that we're using a [data attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Using_data_attributes) to hold the repo name. Data attributes make it super easy to pass data around between DOM elements and JS, so rather than jump through hoops trying to set and query `id` attributes, we'll do this.

The second thing is our `onclick` is explicitly passing `this` to the
`getCommits` function. We need to do this to make sure that the current
element, that is, the link being clicked, is available to our
`getCommits` function so that we can get at that data attribute later.

Now that that's out of the way, let's set up our `getCommits`. It's
going to look very similar to `getRepositories`, because it's mostly
about just making another XHR request to Github.

```js
function getCommits(el) {
  const name = el.dataset.repo
  const req = new XMLHttpRequest()
  req.addEventListener("load", showCommits);
  req.open("GET", 'https://api.github.com/repos/octocat/' + name + '/commits')
  req.send()
}
```

Here we grab that `data-repo` value through the `dataset` property, then
set up an XHR request, with an event listener and callback function,
just like we did in `getRepositories`.

Let's create a place in our HTML to put the commits.

```html
<div>
  <h3>Commits</h3>
  <div id="commits"></div>
</div>
```

Finally, let's handle that request with our callback function. We can
look at the docs for this API call to see the JSON structure and know
what values we want to pull out, then display them on the page.

```js
function showCommits() {
  const commits = JSON.parse(this.responseText)
  const commitsList = `<ul>${commits.map(commit => '<li><strong>' + commit.author.login + '</strong> - ' + commit.commit.message + '</li>').join('')}</ul>`
  document.getElementById("commits").innerHTML = commitsList
}
```

Reload it and check it out. Now we can load repositories, then see
commits for any repository dynamically without refreshing the page or
reloading the repository list!

## Summary

We learned what the `XMLHttpRequest` object does, how to use it to
request data from a remote resource, and how to handle the response. We
also learned how to parse the `responseText` into JSON and display it on
the page.
